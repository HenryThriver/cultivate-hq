*Note: These are nice-to-have optimizations identified during code review. The current implementation is production-ready.*

### Security Enhancements
- [ ] **Token Encryption at Rest** (`src/app/api/google/combined-callback/route.ts:55,90`)
  - **Current**: Google API tokens stored in plaintext in database
  - **Improvement**: Consider encrypting tokens at rest for enhanced security
  - **Impact**: Low priority (tokens are short-lived and properly scoped)
  - **Implementation**: Use Supabase vault or application-level encryption

- [ ] **UUID Collision Prevention** (`src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts:62`)
  - **Current**: Generated UUIDs not validated against existing auth users

  - **Implementation**: Add `SELECT` query to check UUID existence before `INSERT`

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] **Database Query Optimization** (`src/lib/hooks/useUser.ts:40-47`)
  - **Current**: Using nested query `subscription:subscriptions(*)`
  - **Improvement**: Use single `LEFT JOIN` for better performance

  - **Improvement**: Verify test auth tokens match real Supabase implementation
  - **Impact**: Medium priority - prevents auth-related test failures
  - **Implementation**: Compare mock tokens in `test-utils.ts` with actual Supabase auth
  - **Location**: `/e2e/test-utils.ts:109` - `mockAuthenticatedUser()` method

## üî• High Priority (Post-Consolidation)

### Calendar Sync RLS Issues
- **Issue**: Manual calendar sync still showing RLS errors in terminal:
  - "new row violates row-level security policy for table calendar_sync_logs"  
  - "permission denied for table users"
- **Status**: Background automation works, but manual UI sync has RLS conflicts
- **Next Steps**: 
  - Debug the exact RLS policy conflict between UI and background sync
