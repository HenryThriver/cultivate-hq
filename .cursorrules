# Connection OS Development Rules

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 with App Router and TypeScript
- Supabase for database and auth
- Material-UI (MUI) v5 for components
- Tailwind CSS for custom styling
- Zustand for client state management
- TanStack Query for server state

## Project Structure

    globals.css
    layout.tsx
    page.tsx
  components/
    ui/                   # Reusable UI components

    utils/               # Utility functions
    hooks/               # Custom hooks
    stores/              # Zustand stores
  types/                 # TypeScript type definitions

## Code Style Preferences

### TypeScript
- Use strict mode
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes
- Use `type` for unions and primitives
- Always define return types for functions
- Use proper generic constraints

### React Patterns
- Use functional components exclusively
- Prefer custom hooks for logic extraction
- Use React.memo() for expensive components
- Always use proper dependency arrays in useEffect

### Imports
- Group imports: React, third-party, internal components, utilities
- Use absolute imports with @ alias for src/
- Prefer named exports over default exports (except for pages)

### Component Structure
interface ComponentProps {
  // Props interface
}

export const ComponentName = ({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentProps) => {
  // Hooks at top
  // Event handlers
  // Render logic
  
  return (
    // JSX
  );
};

### MUI + Tailwind Integration
- Use MUI components for structure (Box, Container, Typography)
- Use Tailwind for spacing, sizing, and custom styles
- Prefer MUI's sx prop over className when using MUI components
- Use Tailwind classes for layout and spacing

### Database Patterns
- Use Supabase generated types
- Create custom hooks for database operations
- Always handle loading and error states
- Use optimistic updates where appropriate

### File Naming
- Components: PascalCase (ContactCard.tsx)
- Hooks: camelCase starting with 'use' (useContacts.ts)
- Utilities: camelCase (formatDate.ts)
- Pages: lowercase with hyphens (contact-details/page.tsx)

### State Management
- Use Zustand for client-side state that needs to persist across components
- Use TanStack Query for server state and caching
- Keep component state local when possible
- Use proper TypeScript types for all stores

### Error Handling
- Always wrap API calls in try-catch
- Use React Error Boundaries for component errors
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Log errors for debugging

### Performance
- Use React.memo for expensive renders
- Implement proper loading states
- Use Suspense boundaries where appropriate
- Optimize images with Next.js Image component

## Supabase Conventions
- My Supabase project ID is zepawphplcisievcdugz. At the beginning of a new chat link the project but after that do not invoke "--project-id zepawphplcisievcdugz" at the end of supabase commands because it isn't necessary and will simply apply to the linked to the project
- Make all changes in the cloud version of my supabase db. To do that successfully, run with the npx command "echo "Y" | npx supabase db push" so that it's auto applied
- Connect to the cloud project at the beginning of each chat thread
- When creating migrations, use "python3 -c 'import datetime; print(datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M%S"))'" to get the proper datetime to name the migration file
- When applying migrations, apply them to the cloud instance where I am developing directly
- If you ever have questions about the database structure, look through the migrations to see how the database is built
- Use Row Level Security (RLS) for all tables
- Create typed clients using generated types
- Use real-time subscriptions sparingly
- Prefer edge functions for complex server logic

## Artifact System Patterns
- All artifacts must have: timestamp, content, type, contact_id
- Use discriminated unions for artifact types
- Create specific interfaces for each artifact type
- Always validate artifact data before storing

## Loop Management Patterns
- Loops are special artifacts with status tracking
- Use enums for loop states: QUEUED, ACTIVE, PENDING, CLOSED
- Include ownership tracking (whose turn it is)
- Implement proper state transitions

## Testing Preferences
- Write unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Mock Supabase client in tests
- Test user interactions, not implementation details

## Comments & Documentation
- Use JSDoc for exported functions
- Explain business logic with inline comments
- Document complex algorithms or data transformations
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

## Git Conventions
- Use conventional commits: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep commits small and focused
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Use feature branches for new functionality

Remember: 
- Always prioritize user experience and data privacy
- Keep the artifact foundation as the core abstraction
- Build iteratively - start simple and add complexity
- Focus on the relationship intelligence workflow
