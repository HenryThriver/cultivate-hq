## Git Flow & CI/CD Workflow

### Branch Progression Strategy
Our repository follows a structured Git flow for continuous deployment with zero downtime:

```
local feature ‚Üí feature/* (push) ‚Üí develop (PR) ‚Üí staging (PR) ‚Üí main (PR)
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: NEVER CREATE PRS TO MAIN DIRECTLY**
- Feature branches MUST target `develop` branch
- Only `staging` branch creates PRs to `main`
- This is enforced by GitHub branch protection rules
- Violating this flow breaks CI/CD and deployment strategy

### AI Assistant Git Flow Rules
**For Claude Code and other AI assistants:**

1. **ALWAYS check current branch before creating PRs**:
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```

2. **PR creation commands MUST specify base branch**:
   ```bash
   # ‚úÖ CORRECT: Feature branch to develop
   gh pr create --base develop --title "..." --body "..."
   
   # ‚ùå WRONG: Never target main directly
   gh pr create --base main --title "..." --body "..."
   ```

3. **When user says "pr to dev", translate to**:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --base develop --title "..." --body "..."
   ```

4. **REFUSE to create PRs to main from feature branches**:
   - If user requests "pr to main" from a feature branch, explain the git flow
   - Suggest they first merge to develop, then staging, then main
   - Only create main PRs when current branch is `staging`

### PR Feedback Loop Workflow
After pushing to a PR, follow this systematic approach:

1. **Wait Phase (180 seconds)**: Allow all CI/CD processes to complete
2. **Check PR Comments**: Use `gh pr view --comments` to read automated feedback
   - **CRITICAL**: Only review comments posted AFTER the most recent push
   - This ensures you're addressing current issues, not outdated feedback
3. **Analyze Feedback Sources**:
   - ‚ùå Vercel deployment status (build errors, env issues)
   - ‚ùå Supabase preview environment (migration failures)
   - üîç Claude AI code review (bugs, performance, security)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Quality Gates (TypeScript, ESLint, tests)
4. **Create Fix Plan**: Prioritize deployment failures ‚Üí security issues ‚Üí code quality
5. **Fix Locally**: Run all quality gates before pushing again
6. **Iterate**: Repeat until all checks pass

## Essential Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server with Turbopack
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint

# Development Server Management
npm run dev:clean    # Kill all instances and start fresh dev server
npm run dev:check    # Interactive port/process checker with options
npm run dev:kill     # Kill all Next.js development processes
npm run dev:ports    # Check which ports are occupied by development servers

# Testing
npm run test         # Run unit tests with Vitest
npm run test:e2e     # Run E2E tests (auto-clears .next cache)
npm run test:e2e:clean  # Run E2E tests with full cache clear (includes test-results)
```

### Pre-Commit Quality Gates ‚ö°
**CRITICAL: Run these checks locally BEFORE pushing to PR to avoid wasting PR cycles**

```bash
# Complete Quality Gates verification (run ALL before pushing):

# 1. TypeScript compilation check
npx tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.ci.json

# 2. ESLint check  
npm run lint

# 3. Next.js build check (catches Suspense, hydration, and build issues)
npm run build

# 4. Database migration validation (if migrations changed)
supabase start  # Ensure local database is running
supabase db push --local  # Test migrations locally first

# If ALL checks pass ‚úÖ, then push to PR:
git push origin feature/your-branch
```

**Why this matters:** These are the EXACT same checks that GitHub Actions Quality Gates run. Running them locally catches issues before they waste PR cycles and prevents frustrating build failures.

### Post-Push PR Monitoring
After pushing to a PR:

```bash
# Wait ~3 minutes for all CI/CD to complete, then:
gh pr view --comments

# Focus ONLY on comments after your latest push
# Create a fix plan based on the feedback
# Fix locally, verify with quality gates, push again
```

### Database Operations
**CRITICAL: PRODUCTION DATABASE PROTECTION - READ BEFORE ANY DATABASE OPERATIONS**

#### PRODUCTION SAFETY PROTOCOL ‚ö†Ô∏è

**MANDATORY: Check environment BEFORE any database command**
```bash
# ALWAYS run this first - look for ‚óè symbol
supabase projects list

# If ‚óè is next to zepawphplcisievcdugz (production), STOP IMMEDIATELY!
# NEVER run database modifications on production directly
```

#### Environment Management
```bash
# Production project: zepawphplcisievcdugz (cultivate-hq) ‚ö†Ô∏è PROTECTED

# Link to staging for development work:
supabase link --project-ref oogajqshbhnjdrwqlffa --password "..."

# FORBIDDEN: Direct production linking for migrations
# supabase link --project-ref zepawphplcisievcdugz  # ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS FOR DEVELOPMENT
```

#### PREFERRED: CI/CD Migration Flow (GitHub Integration)
**Use this approach for ALL database changes**

At the beginning of each coding session, confirm what environment we are working in (local, dev, or staging) and then open the repo for the branch in focus. If this is a net new feature, create a new branch with an appropriate title.

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch (REQUIRED)
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# 2. Create migration files locally (SAFE)
TIMESTAMP=$(python3 -c 'import datetime; print(datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M%S"))')
touch "supabase/migrations/${TIMESTAMP}_migration_name.sql"
# Edit the migration file with your changes

# 3. Commit and push (SAFE - triggers automated branch database)
git add supabase/migrations/ supabase/config.toml
git commit -m "feat: your database changes"
git push origin feature/your-feature

# 4. Supabase GitHub Integration automatically:
#    - Detects supabase/ directory changes
#    - Creates branch-specific Supabase database (e.g., feature-stripe-abc123)
#    - Applies all migrations to isolated branch database
#    - Posts preview environment URL as PR comment
#    - GitHub Actions validate the preview environment

# 5. Vercel preview deployment automatically uses branch database
# 6. Only after testing: merge to main applies to production

# VERIFICATION: Check PR comments for Supabase preview environment URL
```

#### Emergency Manual Migration (REQUIRES EXPLICIT APPROVAL)
```bash
# ONLY use if CI/CD is broken and user explicitly authorizes

# 1. VERIFY you're NOT on production:
supabase projects list  # Confirm ‚óè is NOT next to zepawphplcisievcdugz

# 2. Apply migration:
echo "Y" | supabase db push --linked

# 3. Generate types:
supabase gen types typescript --linked > src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts
```

#### ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS ‚ùå
```bash
# NEVER run these commands when linked to production:
supabase db push --linked           # ‚ùå Can corrupt production data
supabase db reset --linked          # ‚ùå Destroys production database
supabase db dump --linked --data    # ‚ùå Can impact production performance

# NEVER link to production for development:
supabase link --project-ref zepawphplcisievcdugz  # ‚ùå FORBIDDEN
```

#### AI Assistant Safety Rules
If you are Claude Code or any AI assistant:

1. **ALWAYS check `supabase projects list` BEFORE any database operation**
2. **NEVER run `supabase db push` unless user explicitly confirms current environment**
3. **ALWAYS prefer CI/CD workflow over direct database modifications**
4. **ASK user to confirm environment if unclear**
5. **REFUSE to execute database commands if linked to production without explicit user override**

### Development Workflow Best Practices

```bash
# Starting a new development session
npm run dev:ports    # Check what's currently running
npm run dev:clean    # Clean start if needed (kills all instances)

# Quick status check during development
npm run dev:check    # Interactive tool with options:
                     # - Show current processes
                     # - Kill specific processes
                     # - Start fresh server
                     # - Check port availability

# Ending development session
npm run dev:kill     # Kill all Next.js processes when done

# Common development issues
# - Port conflicts: Use npm run dev:clean to resolve
# - Multiple instances: Use npm run dev:check to manage
# - Auth context errors: Check .env.local for missing API keys
# - Build errors: Run npm run build to identify issues early
```

## Architecture Overview

**Cultivate HQ** is a comprehensive relationship intelligence system built around four core pillars: Strategic Connection Architecture, Proactive Relationship Nurturing, Strategic Ask Management, and Sustainable Systems Design.

### Core Architecture Patterns

#### Centralized Artifact Processing System
- **Configuration-Driven**: All AI processing rules in `artifact_processing_config` database table
- **Zero-Code Extensibility**: New artifact types require only database configuration
- **Unified Edge Function**: `parse-artifact` handles all artifact types with dynamic routing
- **Automatic Triggering**: Database triggers automatically call AI processing when `ai_parsing_status = 'pending'`

#### Universal Artifact Foundation
All relationship intelligence flows through timestamped artifacts:
- Voice memos, meetings, emails, LinkedIn posts/profiles
- Loop management (POGs and Asks) as special artifact types
- Consistent processing pipeline with AI suggestions
- Status tracking: pending ‚Üí processing ‚Üí completed

#### Edge Function Architecture
**CRITICAL**: Use unified processing pattern
- `parse-artifact` is the single edge function for ALL artifact AI processing
- Database triggers automatically call edge functions - don't invoke directly
- To reprocess: Set `ai_parsing_status = 'pending'` in database
- Internal routing based on artifact type and metadata

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router, TypeScript strict mode
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time subscriptions, RLS)
- **UI**: Material-UI v5 components + Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- **State Management**: Zustand (client state) + TanStack Query (server state)
- **External Integrations**: Gmail, Google Calendar, LinkedIn via APIs
- **AI Processing**: Anthropic Claude via edge functions

### Key Domain Concepts

#### Artifacts
All relationship data stored as timestamped artifacts with unified AI processing:
- **Types**: voice_memo, meeting, email, linkedin_post, linkedin_profile, loop
- **Processing**: Automatic AI analysis with suggestions generation
- **Status Tracking**: pending ‚Üí processing ‚Üí completed with timestamps

#### Loops (POGs & Asks)
Special artifacts representing relationship exchanges:
- **POGs**: Packets of Generosity (giving value)
- **Asks**: Requests for help or resources
- **Status Lifecycle**: QUEUED ‚Üí ACTIVE ‚Üí PENDING ‚Üí CLOSED
- **Ownership Tracking**: Whose turn it is to act

#### Contact Intelligence
Comprehensive relationship context:
- **Professional**: Role, company, expertise, career events
- **Personal**: Interests, family, milestones, conversation starters
- **Artifact Timeline**: All interactions chronologically organized
- **Reciprocity Dashboard**: Visual balance of giving/receiving

### Database Safety Rules

- **NEVER** run destructive operations without explicit user approval
- **ALWAYS** use WHERE clauses for UPDATE/DELETE operations
- **ALWAYS** test queries on single records first (add LIMIT 1)
- **NEVER** use `supabase db reset` or data-wiping commands
- **ALWAYS** follow Row Level Security patterns

### Code Conventions

#### TypeScript
- Use strict mode with proper type definitions
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes
- Always define return types for functions
- Use Supabase generated types

#### Component Structure
```typescript
interface ComponentProps {
  // Props interface
}

export const ComponentName = ({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentProps) => {
  // Hooks at top
  // Event handlers
  // Render logic
  
  return (
    // JSX
  );
};
```

#### MUI + Tailwind Integration
- Use MUI components for structure (Box, Container, Typography)
- Use Tailwind for spacing, sizing, and custom styles
- Prefer MUI's sx prop over className when using MUI components

#### State Management
- Zustand for client-side state that persists across components
- TanStack Query for server state and caching
- Keep component state local when possible

### Import Patterns
- Group imports: React, third-party, internal components, utilities
- Use absolute imports with @ alias: `@/components`, `@/lib`, `@/types`
- Prefer named exports over default exports (except pages)

### Testing Approach
- Check existing patterns in the codebase before assuming test frameworks
- Search for test files or scripts in package.json to understand testing setup
- Write unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Test user interactions, not implementation details

### Vendor Documentation Reference
**IMPORTANT**: After 2+ failed attempts with vendor CLI commands or APIs, consult `documentation/VENDOR-DOCS.md` for correct syntax and documentation links. This prevents repeated API/CLI misuse (e.g., incorrect Vercel logs syntax, Vitest command patterns, etc.).

## Git Flow Enforcement Tools

### Safe PR Creation Script
Use the automated script to prevent git flow violations:
```bash
./scripts/safe-pr.sh "Your PR title" "Optional PR body"
```

This script automatically:
- Detects your current branch type
- Selects the correct target branch per git flow
- Creates the PR with proper base branch
- Prevents accidental PRs to main

### Manual PR Creation (AI Assistants)
**MANDATORY checks before creating any PR:**
```bash
# 1. Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# 2. Use correct command based on branch:
# If on feature/* branch:
gh pr create --base develop --title "..." --body "..."

# If on develop branch:
gh pr create --base staging --title "..." --body "..."

# If on staging branch:
gh pr create --base main --title "..." --body "..."
```

# important-instruction-reminders
**CRITICAL GIT FLOW RULES - READ EVERY TIME:**
- Feature branches MUST target develop, NEVER main
- Only staging branch targets main
- When user says "pr to dev" they mean --base develop
- REFUSE to create feature ‚Üí main PRs
- Use ./scripts/safe-pr.sh when in doubt
