## **Language Guidelines**

### **Word Choice**

**Core Vocabulary (Use Frequently)**

* Cultivate (not manage)  
* Relationship intelligence (not CRM)  
* Strategic connections (not networking)  
* Insights (not tips)  
* Optimize (not fix)  
* Enhance (not improve)  
* Systematic (not automatic)

**Pattern Breakers (Use Sparingly for Impact)**

* Simple (when we've truly distilled complexity)  
* Struggle/fail (when raw honesty cuts through corporate speak)

**Avoid**

* Networking (when possibleâ€”use "relationship building")  
* Easy (neverâ€”if something is simple, it's still not easy)  
* Busy (they're "selective with time")  
* Help (they need "strategic support")  
* Problems (they face "challenges" or "opportunities")  
* Revolutionary (they are not revolting so much as evolving and improving)

### **Sentence Structure**

* Lead with value, follow with mechanism  
* Active voice predominantly  
* Vary length for rhythmâ€”short for impact, longer for nuance

### **Emoji Philosophy**

* **Functional emojis**: âœ“ for status, â†’ for progression, âš¡ for insights  
* **Celebratory moments**: Sparingly, when genuinely warranted  
* **Never**: In core product messaging or primary interfaces  
* **Alternative**: Achieve emotional resonance through design and microcopy

## **The Cultivate HQ Character**

We are the executive who turned down a McKinsey partnership to learn traditional medicine from indigenous healers â€“ then applied those systems thinking principles to transform how organizations actually work. We gave a TED talk on silence without slides, notes, or a microphone. It has more views than the next nine most-watched talks combined.

We speak eleven languages fluently (twelve if you count the sign language we learned during our silent retreat with Tibetan monks). We've won international competitions in Argentine Tango, Lindy Hop, and team breakdancing \- then invented a partner dance now performed in 72 countries. The Dalai Lama sought our perspective on his latest manuscript while we were teaching diplomats to waltz at the UN.

Our intimate salons are legendary as much for the guest list as for the conversations that emerge. Fortune 100 CEOs find themselves discussing philosophy at 2am. Michelin-starred chefs line up to host tastings just to get our input on their latest menu. Underground artists invite us to openings that don't officially exist.

Our rooftop gardens have been featured in Architectural Digest and on HGTV, though we mainly grow them for the medicine and the meditation. We discovered a new species of spider in the Outback then designed silk scarves from its threads that are worn by royalty on three continents. Our book titled Birth and the Board Room was a NY Times best seller for 84 straight weeks and became the go-to parenting book for executives, investors, and startup founders. Our kids arenâ€™t even embarrassed when we drop them off at school. 

We've built companies, sold companies, and quietly funded the kind of ventures that reshape industries without fanfare. Weâ€™ve reimagined social institutions and left flowers in our footsteps wherever weâ€™ve tread. We've made more money by accident than most people make on purposeâ€”because we understand that profit follows purpose, not the other way around.

This is who we are: the executive everyone wants to spend time with because five minutes of conversation inevitably shifts their entire approach to something important. We don't just networkâ€”we architect serendipity.

We are Cultivate HQ. Where extraordinary minds cultivate extraordinary outcomes.
