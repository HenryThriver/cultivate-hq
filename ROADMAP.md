### Reciprocity Dashboard
- **Relationship Balance Tracking**: Give/take ratio visualization
  - Acceptance Criteria: Visual dashboard showing reciprocity health across relationships
- **Smart Giver Throttling**: Prevent over-giving alerts
  - Acceptance Criteria: Warnings when relationship balance becomes too one-sided

## Phase 3: Intelligence Features üß†
*Target: Q1-Q2 2026*

### AI-Powered Artifact Intelligence
- **Artifact Processing**: AI analysis of relationship data
  - Acceptance Criteria: Natural language processing of artifacts for insights and patterns
- **Context Synthesis**: Intelligent relationship summaries
  - Acceptance Criteria: Auto-generated relationship briefs before meetings or outreach
- **Pattern Recognition**: Behavioral insights and recommendations
  - Acceptance Criteria: AI suggestions for optimal interaction timing and approach

### Research Automation
- **Public Information Synthesis**: Automated background research
  - Acceptance Criteria: Integration with LinkedIn, company websites, news sources
- **Social Media Monitoring**: Outreach opportunity detection
  - Acceptance Criteria: Alerts for contact achievements, job changes, content sharing
- **Content Intelligence**: Readwise integration for POG generation
  - Acceptance Criteria: Auto-suggested content sharing based on contact interests

### Timing Intelligence
- **Optimal Outreach Detection**: Data-driven timing recommendations

  - Acceptance Criteria: Analytics dashboard showing network diversity and strength
- **Introduction Opportunity Detection**: Mutual benefit matching
  - Acceptance Criteria: AI suggestions for valuable introductions between contacts
- **Goal-Based Network Matching**: Aspirational connection recommendations
  - Acceptance Criteria: Contact suggestions aligned with user's professional and personal goals

### Advanced Integrations
